# Computer vision project 

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

## Milestone 1
* What was done? 
In this milestone, I created the model using https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com. This is a fast way to create a Tensorflow model using Keras. The model was created with 4 classes using images captures from my laptop's camera

* Which classes were created?
I created, Rock, Scisors, Paper and Nothing. The nothing class is the class when the user is with the camera open but nothing doing anything for the game. So the model doest egt confused and try to fit it into a Rock category for instance.
